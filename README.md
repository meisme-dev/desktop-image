## Installation

> **Warning**
> This is an experimental feature and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while!

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

```
sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/meisme-dev/desktop-image:latest
```

This repository builds date tags as well, so if you want to rebase to a particular day's build:

```
sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/meisme-dev/desktop-image:20230403
```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `release.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## Just

The `just` task runner is included in main for further customization after first boot.
You can copy the justfile from `/etc/justfile` to `~/.justfile` to get started. Once `just` supports [include directives](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_52.html), you can just include the file in `/etc` into your own justfile, where you have the option of adding new tasks.
After that run the following commands:

- `just` - Show all tasks, more will be added in the future
- `just bios` - Reboot into the system bios (Useful for dualbooting)
- `just changelogs` - Show the changelogs of the pending update
- Set up distroboxes for the following images:
  - `just distrobox-boxkit`
  - `just distrobox-debian`
  - `just distrobox-opensuse`
  - `just distrobox-ubuntu`
- `just setup-flatpaks` - Install all of the flatpaks declared in recipe.yml
- `just setup-gaming` - Install Steam, Heroic Game Launcher, OBS Studio, Discord, Boatswain, Bottles, and ProtonUp-Qt. MangoHud is installed and enabled by default, hit right Shift-F12 to toggle
- `just update` - Update rpm-ostree, flatpaks, and distroboxes in one command

Check the [just website](https://just.systems) for tips on modifying and adding your own recipes.
